Division of Workload:
In the original implementation, we both met to plan out the layout and logic 
for the project, and then went off to implement half the code each. Then
we met up again to test the code and debugged together. After realizing our
implementation was wrong we both spent a night rewriting all the code.

The report was written by Siddhartha and the PPT was made by David.
